# accmapdecision for INET2005 Web Application Programming I with MySQL

For convenience, I have created a accmapdecision template of an ASP.NET Core 5 project folder and pushed it to github. Note that the name of the project will need to be changed from "accmapdecision" to whatever your project is named. Follow instructions on the index.cshtml view.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `docker compose up --build`
### `dotnet watch run`

To build and run the ASP.NET Core 5 web app
